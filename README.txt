Extract RSS samples into pmdmini directory (for legal reasons not included):

- 2608_BD.WAV
- 2608_HH.WAV
- 2608_RIM.WAV
- 2608_SD.WAV
- 2608_TOM.WAV
- 2608_TOP.WAV

TODO

- pmdplay has some pcmdir functionality, only looks up RSS samples in CWD. figure that out
- ^ workaround: script for setting up pmdmini with PWD = /pmdmini/ directory
- maybe a file watcher for automatic recompiling & playback?
